# Easy Visa Prediction & Process Automation

## 📌 Project Overview
The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) handles thousands of visa applications annually. This project aims to automate the initial screening process by predicting whether a visa application will be **Certified** or **Denied**. By leveraging Machine Learning, the project provides a data-driven approach to help the OFLC streamline its workflow and reduce manual processing time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Algorithms:** **XGBoost** (Primary Model), AdaBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees
* **Key Techniques:** Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV), Precision-Recall Trade-off, Handling Class Imbalance.



## 🚀 Key Engineering & Analytical Highlights
* **Model Optimization:** Evaluated multiple ensemble models and selected **XGBoost** as the final model due to its robust performance.
* **Optimization for Recall:** The model was tuned to prioritize **Recall (0.86)**, ensuring a high capture rate of certifiable applications.
* **Data Insight:** Identified that employer profile, prevailing wage, and unit of pay are the most critical factors in visa approval.

## 📊 Results & Business Impact
* **Recall:** Achieved a high score of **0.86**.
* **Accuracy:** Maintained a steady accuracy of **0.74**.
* **Automation Potential:** Acts as a "first-level filter" for routine certifications.

## 💡 Key Learnings
* Deepened understanding of **Boosting Algorithms**.
* Learned the importance of choosing metrics based on business problems.
* Improved skills in feature engineering and statistical validation.
